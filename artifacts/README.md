# Artifacts

This directory contains files that were created during the development of the HTMX Examples Vector Database project but are not essential for reproducing the workflow.

These files are likely remnants of experiments, alternative approaches that were abandoned, or support/debugging scripts that aren't part of the core execution.

They are kept here for reference purposes but can be safely ignored when following the main workflow.
