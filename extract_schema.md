Take a look at a couple of the example files. I am interested in embedding the examples in a vector database in the way that would make them most useful for an LLM agent with a semantic search tool. Suggest a JSON schema to use in a data cleaning pipeline for transforming the examples into clean, embeddable text with useful, filterable metadata. Save the schema as a JSON file named `htmx_examples_schema.json`.
