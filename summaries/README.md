# Workflow Summaries

This directory contains summaries of the workflow used to create the HTMX Examples Vector Database project.

## Files

- `final_workflow_summary.md` - The main, concise summary of the entire workflow
- `workflow_summary.md` - A more detailed summary combining all individual summaries
- `*_summary.md` - Individual summaries of specific conversation logs

## Updating Summaries

To update the summaries based on the latest conversation logs, run:

```bash
./update_workflow_summary.sh
```

This script will:
1. Process all conversation logs in `.specstory/history/`
2. Generate individual summaries for each log
3. Combine them into a comprehensive summary
4. Create a final, concise summary

## Using the Summaries

The `final_workflow_summary.md` file provides a step-by-step guide to reproduce the entire workflow, from scraping HTMX examples to setting up the PostgREST API with vector similarity search. It includes:

- Key files used at each step
- Commands to execute
- Expected outputs
- Complete workflow execution steps

This documentation is designed to make it easy to understand and reproduce the workflow in the future.
