To interact with PostgreSQL databases, you can use the Digital Ocean CLI tool, `doctl`, and the `psql` tool. You also have `docker compose`, in case you can find a way to use that with Digital Ocean. (Keep in mind that we're deploying remote services, not local ones.)

The user may or may not need to run `doctl auth init` if you run into any authentication problems.

The `psql` tool's command-line interface and pager and mostly inaccessible to you due to limitations of your toolset, so it's best to prefix PGPASSWORD to your commands and to use the `-t` (tuples only) flag and pipe the output to sdout with `| cat` so as to avoid the need for user intervention to enter passwords or manually page through outputs.
