To help with obtaining guidance from the web, you can use either your built-in web search tool or call an LLM search specialist. The latter option, is available through a Python `perplexity` CLI tool that you can run like:

```bash
uv run perplexity "How do I accomplish some task using some programming tool, given some set of goals and constrints? Provide a concrete example."
```
